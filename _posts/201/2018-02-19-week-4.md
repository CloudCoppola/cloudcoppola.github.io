23/02/2018 - Had a group meeting in B20. Our new member of the group Sean was able to come to the meeting to get an update as to what has happened so far with regards to the progress of project. As a group we reviewed version 3.0 of the test specifications and Hui made a list of alterations to be made after the meeting before it was to be uploaded on Gitlab. Daniel wanted to discuss setting up a Google calendar or Facebook events for when we have meetings to record who is going to be at the meetings, but as I stated by doing that we would waste time having to setup an event for each meeting when more time can be put into the project. The group discussed the topic and decided to have a reminder on the Facebook group chat for when we have meetings. As I was responsible for taking down the minutes I will type them up in the next 24 hours and upload them to the Gitlab. I also planned on altering the format of some of the minutes so that they are easier to understand for the members and other users viewing them. Time Spent: 1 hour
