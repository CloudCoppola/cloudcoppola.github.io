05/03/2017 - I took the minutes for the meeting and typed them up later throughout the day. I wasn't able to work on the technical documentation over the weekend as I was more focused on my Robotics assignment. Time Spent: 2 hours

07/03/2018 - Had another meeting with the group to get an update on peoples progress. Half of the group were unable to attend and some of those didn't provide reason for absence. So we wanted to bring this forward during the next meeting. For the technical documentation I was still unable to work on it because I had a AI assignment handin on the 09/02/2018. Time Spent: 1 hour 

09/03/2018 - As my assignments are out of the way I was able to focus back on the group project. The meeting we had today was to discuss "meetings" in general, as members are unable to attend Wednesdays we should change the Friday preferably. We also looked over the feedback from Chris Price as a group. People were given tasks to do throughout the week. The minutes taken down will be typed up and uploaded to Gitlab in the next 24 hours. Time Spent: 1 hour

10/03/2018 - I've been spending the day reorganizing my blogs into weeks and checking over them. Also typed up the minutes from yesterdays meeting and uploaded it to Gitlab. Time Spent: 4 hours
