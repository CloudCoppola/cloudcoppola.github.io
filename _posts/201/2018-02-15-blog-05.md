I went to PJM lounge to work with Przemek(prk3) on the software architecture. He drew the classes and relationships on a board to provide a visual representation of the program. 

After understanding their relationships I created the UML diagram using the IntelliJ tool and uploaded it to our shared Google folder. 

There was a brief discussion over the group chat about changing meeting days and having a meeting  where we work together for a period of time.
