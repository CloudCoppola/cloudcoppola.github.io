This is a personal blog page that can be located at cloudcoppola.github.io, I have used the resources forked from barryclark/jekyll-now. The reason why I am using Jekyll is to record my progress whilst working on the group project “JoggleCube” for the module CS22120 Software Engineering.

“Jekyll is a static site generator which can be used for GitHub hosted blogs (Jekyll Repository).”

Unfortunately I was unable to attend the first tutorial as I was travelling to Belgium for the event known as FOSDEM, I contacted my project manager beforehand to let him know of my situation.  I also had a look at the minutes from the last tutorial, my task is to work with Daniel Holmes (dah51) on creating a rough software architecture for the game. I will contact him soon next week to arrange a meeting and come up with a rough design for the game.
