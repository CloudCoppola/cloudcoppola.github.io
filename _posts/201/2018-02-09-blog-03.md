Updates about the progress of the project were brought forward by each member of the group.

Myself and Daniel (dah51) talked briefly about our rough software architecture to the group and the project manager Wayne Aubrey (waa2). The design wasn’t perfect and I was expecting to hear constructive feedback from each member of the group as well as the project manager. 

What I realised during the tutorial was that there are individuals with their own skills, but there was barely any communication or organisation within the group, most of our work is split up between everyone without being stored on a shared location and there wasn’t enough time spent together. I recommended that we meet twice a week for unofficial meetings to know what we are all up to and start making progress on the project. 

We now meet Monday 14:00-15:00 and Wednesday 15:00-16:00 in G3a Llandinam.

From the tutorial we now can work together on the UML to make it understandable. I will spend time looking over the QA documents and revisiting the specifications for the JoggleCube game.
