I had an unofficial group meeting at the Pentre Jane Morgan lounge this afternoon. I was able to meet some of my group members for the first time and get an update on what myself and two other members missed from the last tutorial, we were told to look at the minutes.

Myself and Daniel (dah51) worked on the start of the rough software architecture design for the JoggleCube game. Rob (raj24) and Przemek (prk3) were able to provide us with details on the how the game would be implemented and what to include in the design. After an hour of work I had plans to be elsewhere, but during the evening I researched more into UMLs and their relationships.
